Please answer the following two questions:

1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?

a word used in sql used to query and get data/info from multiple tables


2. Consider the structure of the posts table: 
why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the 
users table instead of storing the username, first_name, 
and last_name in the posts table?
because the user_id holds both of that info
